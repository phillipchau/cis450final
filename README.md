# CIS 450 Final Project
The shared private repository for the CIS 450 Final Project.

Instructions to build locally:
1. Open two Terminal tabs, one which navigates to the client folder and the other which navigates to the server folder.
2. Run `npm install` on both tabs.
3. After step 2 completes, run `npm start` on both tabs, and navigate to `localhost:3000` on a browser to view the app.

_Notes:
1. In order to use the Facebook login, since it is in development mode, you have to be added on the Facebook Developer portal as a tester.
2. If you are copying this project from the GitHub repository, there are variables in the `.env` file that you need for this app to work properly. Contact the creators of this project to get this variable information.
3. If you run into an error when attempting to log in that says, "The security token included in the request is invalid," then you need to update the tokens in the `.env` file. Contact the creators of this project to get the latest AWS tokens.
